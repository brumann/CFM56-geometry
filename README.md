# CFM56-geometry
A geometric approximation of the CFM56 engine's shape, assuming axisymmetry.

Important: 
The authors do not have access to the full geometry. This reconstruction uses as a basis the in-duct formulation given in Ovenden's article (Ovenden, N., Eversman, W., & Rienstra, S. (2004). Cut-on cut-off transition in flow ducts: comparing multiple-scales and finite-element solutions. In 10th AIAA/CEAS Aeroacoustics Conference (p. 2945).).

How to use:
This file can be open using tecplot 360. It only contains the skin of the engine.
